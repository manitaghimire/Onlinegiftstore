About Project
This project is a static front-end implementation of an online gift store, designed to showcase my skills in HTML and CSS. The goal of this project is to demonstrate my ability to create visually appealing and responsive web pages from scratch using core web development technologies.
Responsive Design: The website is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.
Clean Layout: The layout is organized and easy to navigate, focusing on providing a pleasant user experience.
Custom CSS Styling: All styles are written from scratch using CSS to display various components like product listings, navigation menus, and banners.
